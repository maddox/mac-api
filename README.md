# Mac API!!

Mac API is a simple server allowing you to remotely command certain things on
your Mac. This is mostly useful for a desktop computer that is always on.



## Features

* Wake your display.
* Sleep your display.
* Set your display's brightness.
* Set your volume.
* Toggle Do Not Disturb mode on or off.
* Set the audio device used for input or output.
* Control netflix playback
* Control Spotify playback

## Setup

    script/bootstrap

## Running It
Get up and running immediately with `script/server`.

Mac API will run on port `8686` by default. Use the `PORT` environment
variable to use your own port.

### Forever
Mac API has support for [Forever](https://github.com/foreverjs/forever). It uses
`launchd` on macOS to kick it off so that it starts on boot.

### Development
You can simply run it by calling `script/server`. This will run it in development
mode with logging to standard out.

### Install as Service on macOS

    script/install

## Logging

Mac API logs all of its requests. In `production`, it logs to a file at `log/logs.log`.
In `development` mode, it just logs to stdout.

## Development

Launch the app via `script/server` to run it in the development environment.

## HTTP API

This is a quick overview of the HTTP service. Read [app.js](app.js) if you need more
info. It doesn't do a lot yet.
